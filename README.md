# mern-stack-employee-record

This is a MERN stack application made by following this [tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack-tutorial).

The key takeways from this project was to learn to use Mongodb Atlas which is cloud based database offered by MongoDB.

A error which I did not expect was not being able to connect the node backend to database because my IP address was not whitelisted and hence the connection was blocked.
